# Decision-Tree-Ensemble-with-Explainable-AI-SHAPE-

Background and Methods: Diabetes Prediction: This study proposes machine learning approaches to build decision trees and ensemble models that include Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, and XGBoost to predict patients with diabetes and compare models’ performance.

MLP Model Evaluation:
One way to measure models' performance is to compare the accuracy score and confusion matrix derived from models’ predictions based on inputs, targets, and other required parameters. To evaluate model performance, the accuracy of each model is compared, and predictions are plotted with a confusion matrix. For details, please refer to the model-based observations plot below. Please refer to the Model Summary Table in the appendix below for more information on model performance.

Summary:
After comparing models’ output, it turned out that accuracy scores and confusion matrix play a crucial role in evaluating the performance. The goals were to build the Decision Tree & Ensemble models to demonstrate the power of machine learning in terms of classification & prediction. The observations-based models’ outputs are as follows:

Diabetes Dataset
1. Check for missing values
2. Impute missing values with mean
3. Scaled the dataset
